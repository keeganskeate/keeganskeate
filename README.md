My name is [Keegan Skeate](https://keeganskeate.com) and I am a creator who loves to help. My background is in economics and I have been creating apps for the past handful of years. My latest project is a [laboratory information management system](https://console.cannlytics.com) designed for labs that test cannabis. I'm currently working as a data scientist and administrator at [Cannlytics](https://cannlytics.com), a company that builds [data pipelines](https://cannlytics.com/data) and provides [statistics as a service](https://cannlytics.com/stats) in the cannabis space. Next up:

- 🔥 Growing [Cannlytics](https://cannlytics.com), come enjoy the fire.
- 🌱 Hosting [Cannabis Data Science](https://meetup.com/cannabis-data-science), come join the fun.
- 💬 Ask me about the 💐 cannabis industry, data science 🐍, and building apps 🚀. The sky is the limit!
